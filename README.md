# How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        The new skills I have aquired from this, are going to hlep me in the long run.  I learned a new set because I have neever used OpenGL before.   This project was tough but I worked through it, and was able to hoe my craft a little bit more. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
        I followed all the design topics that we learned. Postioning, texture, lighting.  The main ones that help bring a 2D image to a 3D imag and bring things to life. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
        That I am still not sure.  I will be working on finance software so I'm not sure if this will be used or not, but I am appreciative that I have learned it. 
        
        
# How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        I used the new skills I learned, but also took some old things as far as breaking it down into smaller protions to work on the projrect.  I worked on one portion of it at a time until I was able to get it the way I wanted it to be. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
        It came into play because I worked on it bit by bit ad wouldnt move on until the portion I was working on ran successfully. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
        The breaking into smaller pieces really helped me work through the project as the whole.   I did smaller portions of each section.  EVen when they got difficult I would continue to try and work through them. 
        
        
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
       In my educational pathway, this class gets me the credits I need to graduate. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
       As far as professional pathway is concerned. I will be working mainly with financial software, so I am not sure how I will be using OpenGL with it.  However should my professional career take a turn and it is something I learn, I will be glad that I did take this class, and have some under my belt.
